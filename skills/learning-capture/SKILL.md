name: learning-capture
description: Captures structured learnings at the end of an experiment or release cycle so the next iteration starts from evidence rather than memory. Activate when triggered by CF-08 from the release-decision framework, or when user says "what did we learn", "close this experiment", "we're done with this cycle", "next iteration", "this experiment is over", "capture learning". Activate immediately after a decision is made in evidence-analysis.

# Learning Capture

This skill handles **CF-08: Learning Closure** from the release-decision framework.

Its job is to produce a reusable learning at the end of every cycle — good, bad, or inconclusive — so the next iteration does not start from opinion.

## When to Activate

- A decision has been made (CONTINUE, PAUSE, ROLLBACK CANDIDATE, or INCONCLUSIVE)
- The experiment window has closed
- The user says "what did we learn" or "next iteration"
- Project stage is `deciding` and a decision exists

## On Entry — Read Current State

Before doing any work, read the project from the database using the `project-sync` skill's `get-experiment` command.

Check these fields:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hypothesis` | The claim that was tested |
| `primaryMetric` | What was measured |
| `stage` | Current lifecycle position |
| `experiments` | Experiment records with decision data |
| `lastLearning` | Previous learning (if iterating) |

- If no experiment has a `decision` field → redirect to `evidence-analysis` first
- If `stage` is not `deciding` → a decision may not have been made yet
- If `lastLearning` already contains a learning for this cycle → review rather than recreate

## What a Complete Learning Contains

1. **What changed** — the specific change that was tested (not "improved the UI")
2. **What happened** — the measured outcome with numbers
3. **Confirmed or refuted** — was the hypothesis directionally correct?
4. **Why it likely happened** — the causal interpretation (honest about uncertainty)
5. **Next hypothesis** — what this result suggests to try next

All five are required. A learning missing (4) or (5) does not close the loop.

## Decision Actions

### Produce the learning

Work through each of the five components with the user. Prompt for missing parts one at a time.

### Write to decision context

Use the `project-sync` skill to persist the learning to the database (see Persist State below).

### Surface the next hypothesis

The learning must always end with a directional suggestion for what to test next. This is not a commitment — it is the input to the next `intent-shaping` + `hypothesis-design` cycle.

## Operating Rules

- Do not allow a cycle to close without a written learning
- INCONCLUSIVE cycles still produce learnings — "we learned this measurement approach was inadequate" is valid and complete
- Do not let the learning become a post-mortem — it is forward-facing input
- For longer cycles, write a fuller document to `artifacts/learning-[date].md`
- Hand off to `intent-shaping` for the next cycle
- **Do NOT change `Experiment.status` here.** It remains `decided` (set by `experiment-workspace` when closing) or `archived` if explicitly archiving. Never set it to `"completed"`, `"finished"`, or any other value.

### Persist State

After completing work, use the `project-sync` skill to persist state to the database:

1. `update-state` — save `--lastLearning "..." --lastAction "Learning captured"`
2. `set-stage` — set to `learning`
3. `upsert-experiment` — save `--whatChanged "..." --whatHappened "..." --confirmedOrRefuted "..." --whyItHappened "..." --nextHypothesis "..."`
4. `add-activity` — record what happened, e.g. `--type learning --title "Learning captured"`
